Applicative order first

(gcd 206 40)
(gcd 40 6)
(gcd 6 4)
(gcd 4 2)
(gcd 2 0)
2

Normal order, only if condition is evaluated
(a=0,b=0) -> 0
(a=0,b=1) -> 1
(a=1,b=2) -> 2
(a=2,b=4) -> 4
(a=4,b=7) -> 7
At this point, reduction kicks in, as if condition evaluates to true
Reduction also takes 4 steps.
So, total no of steps = 0+1+2+4+7+4 = 18 steps
